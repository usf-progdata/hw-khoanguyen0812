```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

## ackage Data Used.
```{r}
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
```

## 1.1


```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(country %in% c("China", "France", "Japan") & year == "1970":"1979")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
